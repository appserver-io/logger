## Introduction

logger provides fully thread-safe and PSR-3 compatible logger implementation.

## Installation

You don't have to install logger, as it'll be delivered with the latest appserver.io release. If you want to install it with
your application only, you do this by add

```sh
{
    "require": {
        "appserver-io/logger": "dev-master"
    },
}
```

to your ```composer.json``` and invoke ```composer update``` in your project.
